# Dynamic Path Planning for Autonomous Wheelchairs
### Building a Local and Global Planner in Python

For this project, I designed and built a program that plans and adjusts paths in unstructured environments. In order to accomplish this, a local planner is used to plan an initial path, and a global planner adjusts the path as a simulated wheelchair navigates the initial path.

The local planner was designed by coding and then modifying the A* algorithm, whereas the global planner was designed by building a dynamic window and determining potential safe trajectories within the window. 

This project demonstrated proficiency in the following areas:
* Object-oriented programming
* Algorithms design and analysis
* Data structures (heaps and tree-based structures)
* Calculus

In the future, the project will be imported to ROS and simulated in a 3D environment.
